# M3-data-processing

This work was done during my internship at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC, Madrid), from March to September 2021.
Read the [M3_data_processing.ipynb] (https://github.com/ines-torres/M3-data-processing/M3_data_processing.ipynb) file in order to process M3 data.

You'll have to download the location and reflectance files before processing any data (follow the instructions of the [Lunar_orbiter_data_products.ipynb] (https://github.com/ines-torres/M3-data-processing/Lunar_orbiter_data_products.ipynb) file)
If you encounter any trouble, contact me : ines.torresaure@gmail.com
